# Socially Accessible Denver (Front End) 
Socially Accessible Denver is a full-stack web application designed for users with disabilities to post and read reviews of restaurants, bars, and other social locations in Denver. I was inspired to create this application from my time working in adaptive cycling. After spending all day out riding, the groups I worked with would want a place to go out and enjoy a meal together. Finding a restaurant or bar that could accommodate multiple individuals with disabilities proved to be challenging. This application would help with this by giving a place for individuals with disabilities to share their experiences. 

## Technologies 
**Front End:** React.js and Material Ui

**Back End:** Node.js with Express, PostgreSQl

**API:** Google Places API, and Google Maps Javascript API.

## Features
![Login, Logout, Signup](./GifsForReadMe/SignIn.gif)
<br>
The application first directs users to a sign in page. This was created using material Ui. Signing out will direct users back to the sign in page, and there is a link on the sign in page to sign in as a new user.

<br> 
The Map has a zoom to my location feature as an autocomplete search box. The search box will zoom to the location selected and only returns results in the Denver area. 


## Challenges

## Future Implementation
* An admin login to allow for deleting and updating reviews as needed and track traffic 
* Further accessibility testing including manual checking using screen readers 
* User profile page where they can favorite a location and track the reviews they have posted
